<p><b> I am a junior student in the department of mathematics, Peking University. I love simple and beautiful mathematics. I am highly interested in combinatorics, and I have always been working on various discrete problems now. This is a simple home page to exhibition all the mathematics work I have ever done. Because this is my first year writting papers, maybe there are some papers are poorly written. I will update them in the future. </b></p>
